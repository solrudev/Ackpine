A library providing consistent APIs for installing and uninstalling apps on an Android device.

- **Persistent**: Ackpine persists every session so it can properly handle process death.
- **Deferred**: Ackpine allows to defer user's intervention via customizable high-priority notification.
- **Progress and state updates**: it's easy to observe every session's state and progress updates.
